### About Me

I'm currently learning core mathematics for machine learning, along with early concepts in machine learning and generative AI. I like sharing my progress through simple notes, small projects, and public threads. Right now, I'm just focused on getting better one day at a time and figuring things out as I go



### What I'm Learning

-  Mathematical foundations of machine learning
-  Data handling with numpy and pandas
-  Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning
-  Data preprocessing and feature engineering
-  Neural network architectures and deep learning
